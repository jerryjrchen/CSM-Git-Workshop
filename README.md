# Read Me First
#git-workshop

Welcome to the Git workshop! 

## Directory explanation
* The “readings” directory contains the entire workshop in textual form.
* The “cheat_folders” are there to provide a fallback if you get really lost. Each folder refers to what the repository state should look like **after** completing the relevant reading.

For example, if you want to start on [[Local Git Repo - #2 Branching]], then make a copy of the basics_1 directory.

## Case 1: Attending the workshop in person
* The only thing you need to read for now is the [[Git Setup]] file.
* If you get lost or if the pace of the workshop is too slow/fast for you, the readings are there for you to reference.
* If you break your repo and just want to skip ahead to the next section, the “cheat_folders” are there for you.

## Case 2: After the workshop
* The [[Git Setup]] file is there to get you set up, and then proceed through the rest of the readings in order. You may find the slides useful as well.
